General

Dynamic Programming
  1. LIS O(NlogN)

Tree
  1. Serialize and Deserialize a N-array tree
  2. Find the largest BST in a given binary tree
  3. In a binary tree add the values of all the nodes greater than the present node to the value of the present node.
  4. print all the nodes at a distance k from the present node in the binary tree
  5. Given a binary tree delete a node such that the BST property holds


Linked list
  1 .Find Nth node from last in a linked list without extra space #two_pointer


Bit Manipulation
  1. missing number in array where every element repeat twice except one.


Trie
  1. Alien dictionary

Array
  1. given array of positive and negetive integers partition them such that positives are on left and negetives on right and relative order doesn't change

Algorithms
